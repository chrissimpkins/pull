# Pull

Pull combines HTTP GET file requests and git repository clones to support pulls of the following contents in your OS X clipboard:

- File URL strings
- GitHub repository HTTPS URL strings
- GitHub repository [user]/[project] repository titles

Simply copy the URL string or repository user/project string to the OS X clipboard and click the Pull status menu button.  Pull does the rest.  You will find your pulled files in your Downloads directory.

You can manually launch the application by locating the Pull application with Launchpad.  Click the Pull icon to launch the status menu application.  Copy any of the supported strings to the OS X clipboard and click the Pull status menu icon.
