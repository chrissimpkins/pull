# Pull

Pull combines HTTP GET file requests and git repository clones to support pulls of the following contents in your OS X clipboard:

- File URL strings
- GitHub repository HTTPS URL strings
- GitHub repository [user]/[project] repository titles

Simply copy the URL string or repository user/project string from any application to the OS X clipboard and click the Pull status menu button.  Pull does the rest.  You will find the pulled files in your Downloads directory.
